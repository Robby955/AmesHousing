We will show for a relatively large dataset, it is better and faster to work with a log transformmed sale price, rather than the original saleprice. In the end, we will use the technique of model averaging/blending to combine models. This results in predictions that obtain a score in the top 15% of submission via kaggle.

Of course, we want to get a baseline idea of how each predictor impacts sale price

We will also examine the relationships between predictors themselves.
